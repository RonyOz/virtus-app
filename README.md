## ‚ú® The Virtus Innovation Story

**Virtus** was born from the **WIE (Women in Engineering) student group at Icesi University** during an intense **24-hour DataCamp**. Our team proudly developed this solution, which was recognized earning us first place!

This project isn't just code; it's a testament to rapid prototyping, creative problem-solving, and a deep commitment to addressing student mental health challenges with a fresh, tech-driven approach.
